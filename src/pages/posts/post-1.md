____________________________________________________________________________________________
In this debut blog post, I'll be sharing the story behind the creation of this website, including the inspiration that led me to build it and the innovative use of AI that made it a reality.

## Why I created this site

- **Fun and Learning**: I wanted to expand my knowledge by delving into new technologies such as Astro, and also to refresh my skills in HTML and CSS. It was an enjoyable way to challenge myself while also learning something new.

- **Learning in Public**: One of my goals for this website is to share my current learning journey with the public. By writing blog posts about my experiences, I hope to inspire others to learn alongside me and benefit from the knowledge that I gain.
